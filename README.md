## Motivation:
- India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. In the past decade we have seen a large number of unicorn startups rise in the Indian startup ecosystem which has a global impact. 
- Startups may be small companies but they can play a significant role in economic growth. They create more jobs which mean more employment, and more employment means an improved economy. 
- By using data analysis techniques we can analyze the data and answer various questions related to the Indian startup ecosystem.

## Conclusion:
- Technology-based startups which provide their services to the everyday consumer are very probable to get a lot of funding. We have seen such startups like Flipkart and Paytm.
- A large number of Startups based in metropolitan cities like Bangalore and Mumbai are funded, which may be due to the fact that talent availability is massive in those cities.
- Most of the fundings are either of Private Equity and Seed Funding type.
- Ratan Tata, Indian Angel Network, and Kalaari Capital are some of the top investors in the Indian startup ecosystem.
- Flipkart, Paytm and Rapido Bike taxi are one of the most funded startups whereas Ola Cabs and Swiggy were funded the most number of times.
